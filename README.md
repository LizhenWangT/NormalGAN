We propose NormalGAN, a fast adversarial learning-based method to reconstruct the complete and detailed 3D human from a single RGB-D image.

# Changelog
2020.08.11 Release the test code and pretrained models

# Requirements
The code and released model were trained on
 * Ubuntu 16.04 & Python 3.5.2
 * Pytorch 1.12
 * trimesh 3.2.36
 * Python-opencv 3.4.3 (for Python-opencv >= 4.0, please change Line 266 of **src/ops.py** to `contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask.astype(np.uint8), cv2.RETR_LIST, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)`)

Optional for src/redner.py:
 * Pyrender 0.1.32

Recommend for Kinect v2 python implement
 * [pylibfreenect2](https://github.com/r9y9/pylibfreenect2)


# Pretrained models
Download the pretrained models in [Pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EJfDeow-yUcJm85zaKnZ3HsWGXk0Auze/view?usp=sharing).

Put the pretrained models in **model/pretrained/**

# Testing
Generate the csv file for the image path. 
```
cd datasets
python data_utils/createcsv.py testdata/ test.csv
```

Run the test_offline.sh *(your csv file name)* *(your save dir name)*
```
sh test_offline.sh test.csv testdata
```

Results are shown in **results/testdata/ply**. You can use Poisson Reconstruction to the meshes for better performance of the edge area.

# Testing on your own data
 * You need to **apply the mask to your image** before input them into NormalGAN. 
 * Create **datasets/yourdata/color** and **datasets/yourdata/depth** (use the same filename for your RGB-D image pairs). 
 * Use **data_utils/createcsv.py** to create your csv file.
 * Run **test_offline.sh** to test your data.

Note that, NormalGAN simulate noise of Kinect v2 (or similar ToF depth cameras), the image resolution should be *(512,424)* and *(424,424)* for network input. Please change the intrinsics or image resolution in **src/test_offline.py**.
